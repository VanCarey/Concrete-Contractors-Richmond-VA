    <h3 id="blog">In-Depth Look: Concrete in Richmond VA</h3>
    <p>Working with concrete in Richmond isn’t like working in other regions. The clay-heavy soil, unpredictable freeze-thaw cycles, and humid summers present unique challenges. For example, poor grading can lead to water pooling under concrete slabs, weakening them over time. That’s why we take drainage into account on every residential and commercial job, whether it's a new patio or a warehouse foundation.</p>
    <p>We also understand Richmond's building codes inside and out—permits, setbacks, inspections—you name it. It’s a big deal because if your concrete contractor doesn’t follow the rules, you’re the one left fixing the problem later. Our local experience means no surprises, just smooth project flow from start to finish.</p>
    <p>Whether it’s a new driveway or a full parking lot, we believe you should know what’s happening every step of the way. Here’s how a typical residential project flows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Free Site Consultation</li>
      <li>Estimate & Options</li>
      <li>Site Prep</li>
      <li>Pouring & Finishing</li>
      <li>Curing & Sealing</li>
      <li>Final Walkthrough</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Concrete has evolved. It’s not just gray slabs anymore. With our team, you can explore decorative finishes, color additives, eco-conscious mixes, and more. If you're after form and function, we’ve got the tools and talent to make it happen.</p>
    <p>All concrete develops hairline cracks over time, but proper prep, joint spacing, and sealing drastically reduce visible damage. We always give accurate, itemized estimates and use Richmond-tested sealing solutions to protect your project for the long haul.</p>

    <h3 id="faq">FAQs</h3>
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> How long does concrete take to cure?<br><strong>A:</strong> You can walk on it in 24–48 hours, drive on it in 7 days, and it reaches full strength in 28 days.</p>
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Will my driveway crack?<br><strong>A:</strong> All concrete develops hairline cracks over time, but our prep and joint control keep that to a minimum.</p>
